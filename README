Quick edit of HTML5-bingo written by J. Hobbs for a German TV show.
(Please note, that this is not the sort of code I would use in production tbh. Was just one open source script I could quickly modify instead of writing from scratch. Good enough for a prototype)




HTML5-bingo
by J. Hobbs June 2012
---

WHAT IT IS:

* A bingo board
* Randomizes content on each load
* Reads square data from the data.js file
* Uses data attributes to check for win condition
* Uses CSS transitions for all animation
* Uses Media Queries for optimized mobile experience
* Uses "Hide Address Bar" (via @scottjehl) to hide mobile URL bar
* Uses HTML5 audio for UI feedback
* Uses jquery.tappable.js to improve UI performance on mobile

HOW TO USE:

All data is kept in the "data.js" file. Customize the .json in the data.js file to change the language on the board.
